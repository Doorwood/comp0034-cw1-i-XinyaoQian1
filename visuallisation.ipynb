    "\n",
    "The dashboard was divided into two main parts: Interactive section for target audience to compare several parameters between two different months, and Static section to provide general information. The layout is responsive. However, it was intentionally  designed for pc and opening a full screen. The visualizations are categorized into three rows:\n",

    "## Color Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The target audiences are professional, we shall use consistent colors as too much variation will distract them from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing color themes, here are some principles followed throughout the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, remember that in most cases monochromatic(single-hue) charts suffice, and there may be no need to introduce the extra dimension of color at all.\n",
    "Second, refer to the color wheel and standard harmony rules when choosing your palette. Consider the rule of complementary colors—opposites in the color wheel—to find color pairs, such as blue and orange or yellow and purple. Analogous colors, or neighbors in the color wheel, make good palettes, such as orange, red, and pink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, stay away from pure saturated colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code, the primary color chosen is #636EFA, and the secondary color is #EF553B\n",

The gradient of the line tells us whether it's increasing at a high rate or low rate, or if it's flat which means it's not changing at all[4]. This is what makes the line chart the best choice for our data.
